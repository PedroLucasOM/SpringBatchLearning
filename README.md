- **Reader:** His reader is based in **FlatFileItemReader** typed as General Java Object and reads the delimited file [clients-classifier.txt](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/files/input/clients-classifier.txt), calling the lineMapper to do it and define the type of each item - if it is a [Client](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Client.java) or a [Transaction](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Transaction.java). After it, the records are returned to Step scope.
- **Processor:** His processor is based in **ClassifierCompositeItemProcessor** and, for each object, he verifies if the item is typed as [Client](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Client.java) or [Transaction](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Transaction.java), parsing each type to your respective processor - can be a **ClientProcessor** or a **TransactionProcessor**.
- **Writer:** His writer is based in **ItemWriter** and print in the screen the returned results of the Reader that was delegated to LineMapper.

## BankAccountGenerateJob

**Objective:** This job is responsible to read a list of [Client](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Client.java) in a configured DataSource, process these records and classify by salaryRange and build a [BankAccount](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/BankAccount.java). After it, the writer build a flat file with the valid accounts and persist it in the configured DataSource.

It is configured to calls a Chunk Step that receive a **JdbcPagingItemReader**, a **ClassifierCompositeItemProcessor**, a **ClassifierCompositeItemWriter** and two @Qualifiers - to define the bean that will be injected - with two writers typed as **FlatFileItemWriter** to be call in the stream() - makes the writers typed as **FlatFileItemWriter** explicit in the call, since the **ClassifierCompositeItemWriter** isn't a instance of ItemStream.

The [BankAccountType](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/BankAccountType.java) can be:

- PRATA
- OURO
- PLATINA
- DIAMANTE
- INVALID (case the client has some wrong information)

- **Reader:** His reader is based in **JdbcPagingItemReader** that receive a DataSource with @Qualifier and a pagingQueryProvider to mount the sql query with pagination and a sortKey - in this case, the email - to get the list typed as [Client](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Client.java). This reading way is based in get data from DataSource per page and repeat it for each chunk transaction.
- **Processor:** His processor is based in **ClassifierCompositeItemProcessor** that calls as classifier the custom processor **BankAccountGenerateClassifier**.
- **Custom Processor:** His custom processor implements a Classifier to return to the **ClassifierCompositeItemProcessor**. It is responsible to make a HashMap with the [BankAccountType](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/BankAccountType.java) and your respective processor. After it, it calls the returnFromSalaryRange() method of [BankAccountType](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/BankAccountType.java) parsing the salaryRange and, according this range, return the respective [BankAccountType](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/BankAccountType.java). Finally, it gets in the HashMap previously configured to the respective processor and run it to make the [BankAccount](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/BankAccount.java).
- **Classifier Writer:** His writer is based in **ClassifierCompositeItemWriter** that calls the method classifier(). This method verifies if the generated [BankAccount](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/BankAccount.java) has a instanciated [BankAccountType](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/BankAccountType.java). If it is true, the classifier calls the Composite Account Writer. If it is false, something was wrong with the [Client](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Client.java) and the Invalid Client Writer is called.
- **Invalid Client Writer**: His custom writer takes the invalid clients and make a flat file with the **FlatFileItemWriter** in the following path /files/output/invalidClients.txt.
- **Composite Account Writer:** His custom writer is typed as **CompositeItemWriter** and make a flat file with **FlatFileItemWriter**. This flat file has bankAccountType, maxLimit and clientId as columns. The generated file is putted in the following path: /files/output/bankAccounts.txt. At same time that this happens, these records are persited in a configured DataSource with the **JdbcBatchItemWriter**.

## PointSheetJob

**Objective:** This job is responsible to read a list of [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java) of a configured DataSource, process it verifying if each employee doesn't have any pointRegistry - if true, a invalid [PointSheet](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/PointSheet.java) is builded with only registrationCode field and returned to writer, if false, a [PointSheet](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/PointSheet.java) is builded with all fields and returned to writer too. After that, the writer is called following the following rule: if the item is a invalid [PointSheet](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/PointSheet.java), a file is build with the registrationCode of the list of [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java). Otherwise, a formatted file is build with the correct list of [PointSheet](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/PointSheet.java) at same time they are persisted in the configured DataSource.

It is configured to calls a Chunk Step that receive a **JdbcCursorItemReader**, a **ClassifierCompositeItemProcessor**, a **ClassifierCompositeItemWriter** and two @Qualifiers - to define the bean that will be injected - with two writers. One is typed as **FlatFileItemWriter** and another is typed as **CompositeItemWriter**. Both are called in the stream() - makes the writers typed as **FlatFileItemWriter** and **CompositeItemWriter** explicit in the call, since the **ClassifierCompositeItemWriter** isn't a instance of ItemStream.

- **Reader:** His reader is based in **JdbcCursorItemReader** that receive a DataSource and executes a query to get a list of [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java), making left join with the table where registrationPoints are saved to repeat the [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java) with the date for each registrationDate.
- **Custom Reader:** His custom reader implements a ItemStreamReader, read the returned list of [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java) from **JdbcCursorItemReader** and agroup each duplicated [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java) in a another [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java) with all dates of registrationPoints.
- **Processor:** His processor is based in **ClassifierCompositeItemProcessor** that calls as classifier the custom processor **PointSheetClassifier**.
- **Custom Processor:** His custom processor implements a Classifier to return to the **ClassifierCompositeItemProcessor**. It is responsible to verify if some [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java) doesn't have any pointRegistry. If it returns true, the InvalidPointSheetProcessor is called and a invalid [PointSheet](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/PointSheet.java) is builded. Otherwise, PointSheetProcessor is called and the object is build correctly.
- **Writer:** His writer is based in **ClassifierCompositeItemWriter** and calls a Classifier to choice whitch writer must be called according to the returned [PointSheet](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/PointSheet.java), verifying if he is valid or invalid. If valid, calls the PointSheetComposite Writer. Otherwise, it calls the employeeWithoutPointSheetFile Writer.
- **PointSheetComposite Writer:** His custom writer is responsible to persist in the configured DataSource each [PointSheet](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/PointSheet.java) returned correctly at same time that builds a file with a custom format of [PointSheet](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/PointSheet.java).
- **EmployeeWithoutPointSheetFile Writer:** His custom writer is responsible to build a file with the returned registrations of all invalid [Employee](https://github.com/PedroLucasOM/SpringBatchLearning/blob/master/src/main/java/com/springbatch/SpringBatchLearning/model/Employee.java).
